For our DSFB2 project, we are going to build an app in Shiny to enable zoology students to analyse tracings from a Langendorff assay automatically, as opposed to doing it by hand. The zoology students are investigating the effects of different kinds of snake venom on heart muscle. To do this, they’re using a Langendorff assay. This technique was developed by Oskar Langendorff in the nineteenth century. In the procedure, the excised heart has a cannula inserted into the aorta so that the heart can be retrogradely perfused via the coronary artery. [@WatanabeOkada2018]1 This technique can be used to study the direct effects of, for example, medication on the heart ex vivo. The two most important parameters that can be tracked in this assay are heart rate and contraction force.
